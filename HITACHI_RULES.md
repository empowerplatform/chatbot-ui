You MUST STRICTLY adhere to the following guidelines when using GPT-4:

1.	Always disclose when you use OpenAI to respond to someone internally, or for generating internal 
specifications, backlog content, or code.
a.	Please add this notice to the top or bottom of your response: “This text/code partially or in 
full generated by GPT technology under limited internal trial.”
b.	Disclose prompts for novel tasks (amazing result), and if asked on any workload.
2.	When using GPT-4 for client communications, thoroughly review the generated response before 
sending. Although disclosure is not required in this case, you will be held accountable for any 
inappropriate content.
3.	Automated responses, either internally or externally, are not approved at this time. This phase 
is intended for experimentation only.
4.	Ensure that you follow all company policies and guidelines related to data privacy, 
confidentiality, and information security. This includes not using the AI for generating content that 
involves sensitive or classified information.  
a.	DO NOT SUBMIT TO https://chat.openai.com/ ANY CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  The public model 
DOES collect prompts – so you are leaking the company’s confidential information if you use the public 
openai tool.
b.	With respect to your day-to-day job, I am authorizing you to use your discretion to submit 
certain non-sensitive Hitachi information to OpenAI, including:
i.	Anything empower backlog related.
ii.	Anything code related except that require particularly novel code to be submitted.  Use CoPilot 
for that.
iii.	Anything that asks for high level responses on scenarios which do not contain client names or 
client staff names.
iv.	If you are unsure, reply to this email asking for authorization, and always lean conservative.  
We will create a pivate internface that DOES allow you submit more sensitive information at a later 
time.

5.	Regularly update this email on the progress of this trial, including any successes, challenges, 
or concerns that arise during its implementation. This will help maintain transparency and trust.
6.	If you encounter any ethical dilemmas or potential misuse of the technology, report it 
immediately to your supervisor and myself.
